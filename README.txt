This is module that will recursively scan your local, external, and modules' views and handler convention folders and look for files that are using queries in them.  This will give you an idea of if you are not putting your business logic in your models.

Drop the module inside your modules directory and activate the module in your application.  Then visit the entry point here:

This code comes with no warranties, promises, or puppies.  In fact, it will probably drop your database.
